Map of PGW Worksites project.  This is fairly close to being complete.

What is done:
* Google Maps HTML page centered around Philadelphia
* Multiple markers with text bubbles have been implemented

Issues:
* I was fighting local JS I/O issues.  It would be much easier to run this on a Heroku instance
* Feed is not parsed yet
* Connect to live feed once available from PGW (expected by end of June 2014)

The original files were taken from the following project:
* https://github.com/CfABrigadePhiladelphia/PGW-digs
